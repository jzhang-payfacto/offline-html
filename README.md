## Running page offline

Each web page is fully self-contained, with all necessary JavaScript and CSS included directly in 
its source code. There are no dependencies on external files. To run any page offline on your 
system, save it as an .html file and open it in your web browser.


## Operation and privacy

Each page utilizes JavaScript to enable in-browser encryption and decryption of data. This 
process occurs exclusively within your web browser, ensuring that your data and encryption keys 
remain isolated. No network connections are established during these operations, guaranteeing 
the security and privacy of your information. This claim is verifiable by inspecting page's 
source code.
